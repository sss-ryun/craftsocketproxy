# Craft Socket Proxy
Tunnel Minecraft Servers to a different port or proxy a Minecraft Server through WebSockets.

## Supports
* All Minecraft Versions.
* Any Minecraft Server. (Possibly for other games too.)
* WebSockets.

## Abilities
* Use a CDN like Cloudflare to proxy your Minecraft server.
* Change a Minecraft Server's port number by proxying it.

## Drawbacks
* Added latency depending on how far the client is from the CDN. (if you're proxying through them.)
* Not natively supported in Vanilla Minecraft Java. (Plugins and Mods for support will be developed in the future.)

## Why use this?
* IPv6 to IPv4 and vice-versa address translation for CDNs like Cloudflare. (Don't want to pay for IPv4? Go IPv6 and use WebSockets!)
* It works like a charm.
* DDOS protection if your server is behind a CDN(Cloudflare) proxy.
* Hide your server IP. (Same as above.)
* There is no difference in gameplay except for the added latency. (Which is subjectively unimportant in Minecraft.)
* Guaranteed to support your Minecraft Server no matter how old or how lazy you are on updating in the future.
* Works for Multiplayer Servers.
* Vanilla players won't even know others are in WebSocket proxy unless they are told.
* Data is never processed. This software just shoves it along, making it very efficient, performant, and memory-saving.

## Get Started

Start off by downloading a build from [Releases](https://github.com/sss-ryun/craftsocketproxy/releases/).

### Prerequisites (Requirements)
* At least Java 8+
* Terminal

### Run the jar with the following commands

**Proxy Client (no WebSockets)** `localhost:25565 -> localhost:25566`
```bash
java -jar CraftSocketProxy-1.0.1.jar --c -host localhost -port 25565 -proxy 25566
```
> [!NOTE]
> This one is useful if you can't change the port forwarding settings in your router, and you can't change the server port.
> Simply proxy it to a different port.

**Proxy Client (with WebSockets)** `ws://example.com:80 -> localhost:25565`
```bash
java -jar CraftSocketProxy-1.0.1.jar --c -host example.com -port 80 -proxy 25565
```

> [!WARNING]
> If the supplied port for the client is 80 or 443, then it will automatically attempt to connect to the host through a WebSocket connection.

**Proxy Server (WebSockets)** `localhost:25565 -> ws://localhost:80`
```bash
java -jar CraftSocketProxy-1.0.1.jar --s -host localhost -port 25565 -proxy 80
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have a server using the port 80 and 443, use a different port and reverse proxy it to a different path.
> **Example:** `ws://example.com:80/minecraft`

## Full list of commands:
```text
Arguments:
--c               | Start a Client Proxy
--s               | Start a Server Proxy
-host  <Hostname> | Hostname
-port  <Port>     | Port of Host
-proxy <Port>     | Output port of Proxy
-path  <Path>     | (Optional) Path of WebSocket connection
--version         | Query version
```

> [!WARNING]
> The path requires a `/` at the beginning. `-path /minecraft`

### Examples

I have made three [examples](https://github.com/sss-ryun/craftsocketproxy/tree/master/examples/src/main/kotlin/) if you
want to use this as a dependency and create your own plugin or mod or whatever.
